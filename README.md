Perfect move 👍 — **renaming to `ai-practice-2025` + archiving** is exactly the right call.
Now let’s **fix the README so it honestly reflects what this repo is** and looks professional (not misleading, not over-marketed).

Below is a **clean, corrected, recruiter-safe README**, updated according to your screenshot and intent.

You can **copy–paste this directly** into `README.md`.
